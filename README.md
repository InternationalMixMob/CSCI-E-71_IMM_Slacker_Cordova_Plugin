* **Mobile Hybrid Web Developer**- needs a plugin that is platform agnostic, authentication should be fast and reliable with clear error descriptions.
* **Product Owner** - needs something that is fast to implement, needs to have few impediments to getting a product to market and enhances the productivity of the developer team.
